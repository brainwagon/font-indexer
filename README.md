## The "Too Many Typefonts" collection...


While cleaning my office, I found an old "shareware" CDROM from Chestnut CDROMs, probably 
dating back to the 1990s.  Chestnut CDROMs was a publisher of shareware and freeware CDROMs,
and this disk held a bunch of TrueType fonts.   From the CDROM liner, it's unclear as to
what the copyright status of these fonts might be.   It appears that Chestnut New Media
went out of business in the 1990s, and so any legal claims on this collection is probably
tenuous at best.  That being said, I have no knowledge of the legality of using any of these
fonts, and no permission to redistribute the font collection is granted.

I've used gemini-cli to write a simple program to create an index of these font files.  Feel 
free to use (and redistribute) the font-indexer.py file under the condition of the LICENSE.
